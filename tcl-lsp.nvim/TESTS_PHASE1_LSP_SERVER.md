# TCL LSP Tests - TDD Implementation Summary

## What We've Created

Following the **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** approach outlined in your project documentation, I've created comprehensive tests for the **LSP server initialization and lifecycle management** step. Here's what we have:

## Test Files Created

### 1. `tests/lua/test_server.lua` - Unit Tests

- **Server State Management**: Tests for initialization, state tracking, and cleanup
- **Root Directory Detection**: Tests for finding project roots with various markers (.git, tcl.toml, etc.)
- **Server Command Generation**: Tests for default and custom command creation
- **LSP Capabilities**: Tests for modern LSP capability configuration (2024-2025 standards)
- **Lifecycle Management**: Comprehensive tests for start, stop, restart operations
- **Error Handling**: Tests for graceful failure handling and recovery
- **Configuration Integration**: Tests for user config merging and validation

### 2. `tests/integration/test_lsp_server.lua` - Integration Tests

- **Real Neovim Environment**: Tests that run in actual Neovim instances
- **LSP Communication**: Tests for actual LSP protocol communication with tclsh
- **Multi-Project Support**: Tests for handling multiple TCL projects simultaneously
- **Performance Tests**: Tests ensuring <300ms response times as required
- **Error Recovery**: Tests for handling various failure scenarios
- **Configuration Integration**: Tests for buffer-local and global configuration

### 3. `tests/lua/test_init.lua` - Plugin Entry Point Tests

- **Module Loading**: Tests for plugin initialization and API exposure
- **Setup Function**: Tests for configuration validation and merging
- **LSP Integration**: Tests for command registration and server integration
- **FileType Detection**: Tests for automatic LSP activation on .tcl and .rvt files
- **Error Handling**: Tests for graceful failure handling
- **State Management**: Tests for plugin lifecycle management

### 4. `tests/spec/test_helpers.lua` - Test Utilities

- **Mock Creation**: Comprehensive mocking utilities for vim, LSP, config, and logger
- **File System Utilities**: Helpers for creating temporary projects and files
- **Async Testing**: Utilities for testing LSP operations with proper timing
- **Performance Measurement**: Tools for measuring execution time and memory usage
- **Test Data Generation**: Generators for various TCL content complexity levels
- **Environment Validation**: Checks for required dependencies and permissions

## Key Testing Patterns Implemented

### 1. **Modern Neovim Testing (2024-2025)**

- Uses latest `vim.lsp.config()` and `vim.lsp.enable()` patterns
- Tests against Neovim 0.11+ features
- Includes comprehensive LSP capability testing
- Follows current LSP lifecycle management patterns

### 2. **Comprehensive Mocking**

- Full vim API mocking for isolated unit tests
- LSP client simulation for integration testing
- File system mocking for cross-platform testing
- Configurable mock behaviors for different scenarios

### 3. **Performance Testing**

- Response time measurements (targeting <300ms requirement)
- Memory usage monitoring
- Large file handling tests (1000+ procedures)
- Rapid start/stop cycle testing

### 4. **Error Resilience**

- Tests for missing tclsh executable
- Tests for invalid TCL syntax
- Tests for network/process failures
- Tests for configuration validation

### 5. **Real-World Scenarios**

- Multi-project workspace testing
- Different root marker detection (.git, tcl.toml, project.tcl)
- RVT template file support
- Buffer-local configuration overrides

## Test Coverage Areas

✅ **Server Lifecycle**: Start, stop, restart operations  
✅ **Root Detection**: Project boundary identification  
✅ **Command Generation**: Server command creation  
✅ **Capabilities**: Modern LSP feature support  
✅ **Error Handling**: Graceful failure recovery  
✅ **Configuration**: User config validation and merging  
✅ **Performance**: Response time and memory requirements  
✅ **Integration**: Real Neovim environment testing  
✅ **Multi-Project**: Simultaneous project support  
✅ **FileType**: Automatic activation for TCL/RVT files

## Next Steps (TDD Cycle)

Now that we have comprehensive tests, the next step in the TDD cycle is:

1. **Run the tests** - They should fail since we haven't implemented the actual code yet
2. **Implement the minimum code** to make tests pass
3. **Refactor** the implementation while keeping tests green
4. **Move to next feature** with the same TDD cycle

This follows your project's emphasis on:

> **Test-Driven Development (TDD) Approach**: Write Documentation First → Write Tests → Implement Function → Verify Coverage → Generate Docs

## Running the Tests

The tests are designed to work with Busted as specified in your Makefile:

```bash
make test-unit    # Run unit tests
make test-integration  # Run integration tests
make test         # Run all tests
```

The tests include proper environment validation and will skip tests gracefully if dependencies (like tclsh) are not available, while still providing meaningful feedback about what's missing.
